\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:dmd_conclusion}
A method of mapping a camera image to the pixels on a DMD chip was developed. This method is highly adaptable and can be used in future experiments as well. With this mapping algorithm, a pattern correction was implemented that is able to reduce deviations and image defects. Here, the focus was set on the reduction of errors coming from extraneous light. One of the tests performed showed that starting from a pattern of noise with inital RMS values of up to \SI{15}{\percent} of the maximum brightness, this algorithm was able to produe a surface with a remaining RMS error below \SI{1}{\percent}. For this task, less than 11 iterations were necessary in most cases.

We also evaluated the spatial resolution and found that pattern with an extent of $\sim\!\SI{3}{px}$ on the camera could be resolved.
